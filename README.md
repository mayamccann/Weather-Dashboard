# üèÜ Weather Dashboard üèÜ
Server-Side APIs with feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS

## üí° Background
For this assignment, the goal is to create a Weather Dashboard that focuses on Server-Side APIs. Third-party APIs grant access to its data and functionality through requests of specific parameters to a URL. Obtaining data from another application's APIs and using it for their own purposes is common among developers.  This challenges allows us to focus on our JavaScript skills and allows further practice with our HTML and CSS knowledge learned in the UConn Coding Bootcamp. It is significant to note that this Weather Dashboard can be shared with those in the computer science community.

## üí° Description 

* The purpose of this challenge is to create an interactive webpage that allows users to complete a timed-coding quiz! The funcitionality of this web application will determine the level of success this webpage holds to its users. Not only do the interactive users embrace the applied knowledge of the developers, this quiz offers furthering education through the quiz. This focal point of this code quiz is Web APIs, but there are bonus questions that cover HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. 

* JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills will be showcased when users view this webpage that focuses on functionality of the application.

* The webpage will offer users a chance for users to obtain weather information based on their desired location. The user will research the weather of their desired city and recieve the current and future conditions that is presented with the city name, date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and the wind speed.

## üí°Credits

Code Source : applied throughout the entire process of building to our starter code for this interactive web application! Credits are devoted to the UConn Coding Boot Camp Support Staff (Instructional Staff, TA, Tutors) and the program's activities and challenges materials and BootCamp Spot/Canvas and additional resources given throughout the course and outside research utilizing the Google Chrome browser of information relating to examples of HTML elements, CSS selectors and properties, but most importantly, JavaScript coding skills/methods. Further information utiliized when building from this functional code received from BootCamp Spot/Canvas.
